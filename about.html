    <section>
        <p>I have been able to work with various clients throughout my career, both inside and outside companies, different sectors and clients of all sizes and colors, from multinationals to freelancers who required custom developments or designs.</p><br>
        <p>This has given me a broad knowledge of the design field in many aspects. Working with e-commerce I have had to immerse myself in the user experience. When it is necessary for my work to be purely aesthetic, I have made great studies in interface design. All this, mixed with the knowledge I acquired about marketing, SEO and optimization, as well as programming thanks to working in different companies, has made me become a versatile profile.</p><br><br>
